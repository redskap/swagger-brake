# Command-line interface
## Installation
The command-line interface comes as a pre-packaged JAR application. The package is compiled with Java 11, so make
sure you have Java 11+ installed.

*Note: Java 8 has been tested regularly and no issues have been encountered so far.*
 
Use the latest version of the client, you can download it from 
[here](https://github.com/redskap/swagger-brake/releases).

## Basics
The idea of the command-line interface is to provide a way to integrate swagger-brake into
any type of system, pipeline. There are several configuration parameters available that you 
could use to customize the behavior of swagger-brake.

The most basic usage is to compare 2 Swagger files. 

```bash
$ java -jar swagger-brake.jar --old-api=swagger.json --new-api=swagger.json
Loading old API from swagger.json
Loading new API from swagger.json
Successfully loaded APIs
Starting the check for breaking API changes
Check is finished
No breaking API changes detected
```

## Customizing reporting
The custom reporting functionality is described in the 
[Customizing reporting](../configuration/README.md#customizing-reporting) section.

Note that whatever custom reporting type you set for the command-line interface, console
reporting will always be enabled. 

To configure a custom reporting, the CLI accepts the `--output-formats` argument. The parameter
accepts a comma separated list of reporting formats, in case you want to use multiple reporters.

For file typed reporters like JSON or HTML, you must also pass the `--output-path` argument 
denoting the location where the reports should be saved.

An example configuration could look the following:
```bash
$ java -jar swagger-brake.jar --old-api=swagger.json --new-api=swagger2.json --output-formats=STDOUT,JSON,HTML --output-path=/home/user/swagger-brake
```

## Deprecating APIs
The API deprecation support is described in the 
[Deprecating APIs](../configuration/README.md#deprecating-apis) section.

The `--deprecated-api-deletion-allowed` parameter is responsible for setting this behavior. 
The default value is `true`, so **there's no additional configuration is required**, 
but it can be overridden to `false` anytime.

## Latest Maven artifact resolution
Latest Maven artifact resolution is described in detail within the 
[Latest Maven artifact resolution](../configuration/README.md#latest-maven-artifact-resolution) section.

The functionality requires the following parameters:
* `--maven-repo-url`
  * Specifies the release repository base URL. Might be optional in case `--maven-snapshot-repo-url` is provided.
    * Example: `https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-release-local/`
* `--maven-snapshot-repo-url`
  * Specifies the snapshot repository base URL. Might be optional in case `--maven-repo-url` is provided.
    * Example: `https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/`
* `--groupId`
  * The groupId of the artifact 
* `--artifactId`
  * The artifactId of the artifact
* `--current-artifact-version`
  * The version of the artifact that contains the new API. This is used to determine if the snapshot, 
or the release repository needs to be used. 
    * Example values are: 1.0.0, 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    
Example command:
```bash
$ java -jar swagger-brake.jar --new-api=swagger.yaml --maven-repo-url=https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local --maven-snapshot-repo-url=https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local --groupId=com.example --artifactId=petstore-api --current-artifact-version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Note: if you provide both `--old-api` and Maven parameters, `--old-api` will take precedence.

The filename to search for can be customized by providing the `--api-filename` parameter.
Note that it's enough to provide the filename without the extension, in that case the JSON, YAML and YML
extension will be used for scanning.

Example command:
```bash
$ java -jar swagger-brake.jar --new-api=swagger.yaml --maven-repo-url=https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local --maven-snapshot-repo-url=https://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local --groupId=com.example --artifactId=petstore-api --current-artifact-version=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT --api-filename=something.yaml
``` 

It's also possible that the repository is secured with username and password authentication. The following
2 parameters can be used to provide the credentials to access the repository:
* `--maven-repo-username`
* `--maven-repo-password`

## Beta API support
For further reference, check out [Beta API support](../configuration/README.md#beta-api-support) 
in the Configuration section.

By providing the `--beta-api-extension-name`, one can override the default `x-beta-api` attribute name,
and the given one will be used.

Example command:
```bash
$ java -jar swagger-brake.jar --old-api=swagger.yaml --new-api=swagger2.yaml --beta-api-extension-name=x-custom-beta-attributes
```

## Excluding paths from the scan
For detailed description on the feature, see [Excluding paths from the scan](../configuration/README.md#excluding-paths-from-the-scan).

There's a parameter `--excluded-paths` where you can provide a list of paths you want to be excluded
from the check. The paths can be separated by commas.

Example command:

```bash
$ java -jar swagger-brake.jar --old-api=swagger.yaml --new-api=swagger2.yaml --excluded-paths=/auth 
```
